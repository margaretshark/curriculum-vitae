I am a passionate data scientist and researcher, who is driven by predictive ML, signal/audio processing and NLP.\n
 My engineering background gives me a good advantage for understanding customers pain and dividing problems into subtasks.\n
 I am also experienced in conducting scientific research for the Schlumberger Moscow Research (signal processing problems) \n
 and for the Skoltech Center of Petroleum Science and Engineering (time-series data processing for accidents detection \n
 while drilling).\n
 Now I work as a data scientist for Severstal. I have experience in developing solutions from scratch \n
 and deploying them into  production. I am open to new job opportunities in Israel.
