***

I am a passionate data scientist and researcher, who is driven by predictive ML, signal/audio processing and NLP.

My engineering background gives me a good advantage for understanding customers pain and dividing problems into subtasks.
I am also experienced in conducting scientific research for the Schlumberger Moscow Research (signal processing problems)
and for the Skoltech Center of Petroleum Science and Engineering (time-series data processing for accidents detection while drilling).

Now I work as a data scientist for Severstal Digital. I have experience in developing solutions from scratch and 
deploying them into  production. I am open to new job opportunities in Israel.
